As many as times as I've scoured the web looking for free audio books I don't know how I managed to miss [http://librivox.org](http://librivox.org) until recently!  This is a great site for those who can appreciate classic literature, poetry, and anything else in the public domain but have little time for reading.  Summarily, the concept is this:  volunteers record themselves reading the text of public domain works and the recordings are aggregated into freely available audio books!

I just recently finished Robert Louis Stevenson's adventure masterpiece **Treasure Island**.  Shiver me timbers!
