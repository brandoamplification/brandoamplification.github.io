8/13/13 - I just moved to North Dakota, and I'm trying my best to be patient for all my stuff to arrive so I can setup my shop and get going on the first B-2 Bomber.  I'm almost done with the design and am excited to get going on it.  I hope to build this one in a way that I could reproduce without too much trouble.  The B-1 Bomber will need some redesign in the physical construction before I can begin selling them.
