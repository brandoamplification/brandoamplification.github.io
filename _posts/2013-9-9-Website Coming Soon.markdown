8/13/13 – I just moved to North Dakota, and I’m trying my best to be patient for all my stuff to arrive so I can setup my shop and get going on the first B-2 Bomber.  I’m almost done with the design and am excited to get going on it…  I hope to build this one in a way that I could reproduce without too much trouble.  The B-1 Bomber will need some redesign in the physical construction before I can begin selling them.
8/17/13 – I just ordered a CNC machine today and am super excited as this will allow me to create nameplates, faceplates and other things.   Expensive but hopefully worth it.
9/5/13 – still putting the finishing touches on the B-2 Bomber design.  Just about done and ready to order parts
