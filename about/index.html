About | Brando Amplification
=========

In July of 2013, the first B-1 Bomber from Brando Amplification was switched on.  Although these amplifiers are new to the music scene, there has been a long road leading to the culmination of these one of kind amplifiers.  With nearly 15 years as a musician, 7 years as a wood worker, and recently completing a dual specialty degree in both electrical and mechanical engineering, I truly feel that building amplifiers is my life’s work.  It is the combination of these three passions that produce the unique sound of Brando Amps.  Using original circuit designs with top quality components and exotic solid wood construction allows for a distinctive aural and visual experience.
